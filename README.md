A fully responsive, accessible, and mobile-first website built from a professional PDF design.

This project was created as the final challenge for Kevin Powell's [21-day Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) course.

## üîç Overview

This website features a three-section landing layout: a hero with CTA, a features grid, and a highlight section with responsive text and imagery. A toggleable navigation bar is built for mobile-first behavior and transforms into a horizontal layout for larger screens.

The project emphasizes design fidelity, accessibility, and responsive techniques using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or component libraries were used ‚Äî everything was written from scratch.
